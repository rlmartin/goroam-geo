GoRoam GeoMapper
---------------------

This is an old side project I worked on, which I am not actively developing.

The main idea was to allow client users to add a geo tag to HTML elements on their
web pages and automatically generate waypoints on a map embedded on the page. This
would allow the layperson to include a Google Map on, say, a blog post without
having to be super-technical.
